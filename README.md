# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

# Project Overview:

This project applies the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
The objective is to identify valuable customer groups and provide insights that can guide targeted marketing, retention strategies, and business decision-making.

# Tools & Technologies:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset Summary:

•  Dataset Name: Superstore Sales Dataset
•  Records: ~10,000
•  Type: Public retail dataset
•  Includes: Customer details, order information, regional data, product categories, sales, profit, discount, shipping details, etc.

# What is RFM?

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary, a framework used to analyze customer behavior.

(1) Recency (R):
•	Measures how recently a customer made a purchase
•	Recent customers are more likely to buy again

(2) Frequency (F):
•	Measures how often a customer makes purchases
•	Frequent buyers are usually loyal customers

(3) Monetary (M):
•	Measures how much money a customer has spent
•	Higher spending customers are more valuable to the business

# Project Workflow:

•	Loaded and cleaned Superstore customer data using Python.
•	Performed customer and sales analysis across segments, categories, and regions.
•	Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
•	Assigned RFM scores and classified customers into behavioral groups using custom logic.
•	Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms, heatmap) to understand customer patterns.
•	Derived insights to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers.
•	Suggested actionable strategies for targeted marketing and improved retention.

# Business Impact
•	Enabled identification of high-value customers who drive major revenue.
•	Reduced marketing effort by allowing targeted campaigns instead of blanket promotions.
•	Highlighted at-risk customers, helping prevent churn and protect future revenue.
•	Improved decision-making by understanding customer behavior and purchase patterns.
•	Supported the business in prioritizing resources toward profitable customer groups.
